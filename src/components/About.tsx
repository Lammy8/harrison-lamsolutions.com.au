      <h2>About Me</h2>

        <p>
          I'm a third-year student at QUT, pursuing a dual degree in Software Engineering and Cyber Security. 
          I thrive on practical problem-solving and enjoy bridging the gap between building robust software and securing it. 
          My approach is defined by being hands-on, whether I'm debugging code or troubleshooting complex systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          My work ethic is grounded in diverse experiences, balancing my studies with fast-paced roles at Elysium Bar & Restaurant 
          and All Access. These roles have honed my adaptability and communication skills, teaching me the value of 
          reliability and exceeding expectations within a team.
        </p>
        <p>
          Outside of tech, I’m an avid mountain biker and rock climber, hobbies that fuel my drive for overcoming challenges. 
          I am passionate about continuous learning and am currently looking for opportunities to apply my skillsets 
          in a dynamic professional environment.
